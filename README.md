# Fr4nsson's FFXIV Config (FFC) | [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/7TJG9H8Xyf) | [**Download**](https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy14/mods/1054?tab=files)
A complete config for FFXIV with a clean informational HUD layout. All jobs have their spells already assigned to hotbars. This is not a mod and is thus not against [**TOS**](https://support.na.square-enix.com/rule.php?id=5382&la=1), it is 100% safe to use.

### About

This is a complete config for FFXIV that I've been working on for a very long time. It is very time consuming to figure out a good hud layout and then position all the hud elements and after that is done come up with good keybinds for your jobs, and if possible, keybinds that fits logically with other similar spells between jobs and remember, ffxiv has 20 jobs as I'm writing this (31 with professions included).

When you take all that into consideration it is not something that is easily done or something that you'd manage to do right away, it would take a lot of trial and error and you would change binds over time. I've done that journey for you so you can focus on playing the game instead. If you're one that likes to fiddle around with hud and keybinds and find enjoyment in that, like I do, this is probably not for you. This is for the people that don't wanna deal with that.

Obviously not everyone might like the layout or the keybinds, there may also be some stuff that I've missed or some spells that would fit better in a different slot. This is a work in progress after all. If you have any suggestions for improvements, feel free to post it.
